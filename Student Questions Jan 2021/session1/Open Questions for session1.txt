Open Questions for Jan 2021

1. What about dealing with dialects like Swiss or Austrian German?

According to documentation German tree banks in R include:  
german-gsd: "GSD" are the basic, meant to be universal 
german-hdt: Hamburg Dependency Treebank, created at the University of Hamburg

2. Another use case is political science which may be of interest.
Example political tweet data sets from a time of protests in the US are within this folder.

3. Is there a function that performs a substitution and trimws?  Yes...I forgot during class but this code will suffice:

```{r}
#https://rdrr.io/cran/stringi/man/stri_replace.html

library(stringi)

txt <- c('this is a bit of text',
         'this is a bit of txt')

# Psuedo Code: stri_replace_all(text vector, replacement, pattern to find)
stri_replace_all(txt, 'text', regex = 'txt')
#notice the trailing space is removed
stri_replace_all(txt, '', regex = 'a bit of ')
```
